# Fraud-Detection
 Fraud is one of the most significant issues the finance sector faces. It is incredibly costly. According to one study, it is estimated that the typical organization loses 5% of its annual revenue to fraud each year. When applied to the 2017 estimated Gross World Product of $79.6 trillion, this translates to potential global losses of up to $4 trillion.

In this project, we use various classification-based models to detect whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.

The dataset used is obtained from Kaggle. This dataset holds transactions by European cardholders that occurred over two days in September 2013, with 492 cases of fraud out of 284,807 transactions.
